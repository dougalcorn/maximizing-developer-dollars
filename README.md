# Gaslight's super awesome slide deck

Featuring an awesome Gaslight theme powered by [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/),
[Bourbon](http://thoughtbot.com/bourbon/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
Use this as a starting point for your next presentation. Might not make much
sense unless you're a Gaslighter or a huge fan, though.

## Setup

Want to make changes? Just follow these steps:

1. `git clone git://github.com/gaslight/slides.git`
1. `cd slides`
1. `npm install grunt -g`
1. `npm install`
1. `grunt`

That's it! Edit `slides.eco` and `stylesheets/index.scss` to change your presentation.
It'll automagically compile everything to the `compiled` dir so you can just reload the 
page to see your changes. Browse to http://localhost:8000/ and bask in the glory.
